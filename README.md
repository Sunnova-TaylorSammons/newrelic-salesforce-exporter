# Salesforce Event Logs integration for NewRelic Logs

 *Salesforce Event Logs integration for NewRelic Logs* offers an integration to process and foward Salesforce event log files to [NewRelic Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs)    
    
## Installation    
    
    
    
 ## Configuration    
 To collect Salesforce event log data, you have to have read access to the Salesforce event log and enable the Salesforce event log file API.    
Create a Salesforce 'Connected App' to use OAuth authentication.    
    
Then fill in the relevant information in the **config.yml** file in the root folder     
  
 1. Update the service parameters 
	 - **run_as_service**:  True or False. True will run this application as a service with an interval cron service on a schedule specified in *service_schedule* parameter. False is useful to setup this application up to be invoked by crontab. The crontab frequency should then be specified using the *cron_interval_minutes* parameter.
	 - **cron_interval_minutes**:  Required only if *run_as_service* is False. 
	 - **service_schedule**: Required only if *run_as_service* is True. The *hour* attribute specifies all the hours (0 - 23, comma separated) to invoke the application to fetch logs. Use * as wildcard to invoke the application every hour. The *minute* attribute specifies all the minutes (0 - 59, comma separated) at which invoke the application to fetch logs. For example { "hour" = "*", "minute" = "0, 15, 30, 45"}  will fetch logs every hour on the hour as well as the 15 minute, 30 minute and 45th minute past every hour. 
	
 2. Update the **instances** section with the *name*, connection  
   *arguments* and *labels* for each salesforce instance from which to fetch event logs files.  
     
	- **token_url**: The salesforce url to authenticate and obtain an *oauth access_token* and *sfdc_instance_url* for further queries  
	- **auth**: Provide the oauth application credentials to use for authentication. See [Authentication](#authentication) section below. 
	- **cache_enabled**: True or False. If True, you must provide a redis server to cache all log file ids and message ids processed by this application. This allows the application to perform log message deduplication so that previously processed logs are skipped  
	- **redis**: (optional). Required only when cache_enabled is True  
	- **date_field**: The date to use in salesforce query for fetching event log files. It can be *LogDate* or *CreatedDate*. See note below regarding best practice on setting this field  
	- **generation_interval**: The frequency at which salesforce is configured to generate log files. It can be "Hourly" or "Daily"  
	- **time_lag_minutes**: A time lag to use when this application queries salesforce for event log files. See note below regarding best practice on setting this field  

	**Note about cache_enabled, date_field and time_lag_minutes arguments** If a *redis cache* is not enabled and thereby disabling log message deduplication, we want to download and process every log file only *once* but with a lag to ensure we are picking most message for occured in that time period. So in this case, it is best to use *LogDate* as the date_field to use in queries and setup a lag of 3 - 5 hours (180 - 300 minutes) as that is the time it could take (when the production servers are under load) for most of the generated log messages to be archived by salesforce log service and become available for download through salesforce queries . When a lag is specified, the application requests log activity for an interval in the past rather than current time.   
On the other hand, if a *redis cache* is enabled, then use *CreatedDate* for use in salesforce log queries and set the lag to 0. In this case, we are going to query for all log files updated with additional log messages since this application last ran (or the cron tab interval) and process them.   
So the two recommended combinations for this set of arguments are  
  
   - **cache_enabled**=false, **date_field**=LogDate and **time_lag_minutes**=180  
   - **cache_enabled**=true, **redis**={...}, **date_field**=CreatedDate and **time_lag_minutes**=0  
          
 3. Update the **newrelic** section with
    - **data_format**: `logs` or `events`. Correspondingly Salesforce event log data is formatted and posted to New Relic Logs API or Events API endpoints
    - **api_endpoint**: `US` or `EU` or the full api endpoint URL for the chosen data_format collector endpoint
    - **account_id**: Required only when `data_format` is `events`
    - **license_key**: New Relic account license key


## Authentication
This integration supports the OAuth 2.0 Username Password and OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Token methods of authentication. The JWT Bearer flow is strongly recommended as it does not expose any passwords.

For OAuth 2.0 Username Password Flow, the auth section template is
```
	auth: {
		"grant_type": "password",
		"client_id": "",
		"client_secret": "",
		"username": "",
		"password": ""
	}
```

For OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Flow, the auth section template is
```
	auth: {
        "grant_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer",
        "client_id": "",
        "private_key": "path_to_private_key",
        "subject": "",
        "audience": "https://login.salesforce.com"
    }
```
    

## Usage    
 1. Run  `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies    
 2. Run  `python src/__main__.py` to run the integration
